[Project Evolution]() is a virtual simulation of autonomous living objects which integrates genetic algorithms and autonomous agent with OOP design principles. It is created on a web platform where organisms interact with each other and simulate its life cycle.

## Autonomous Agents

Autonomous Agents are simply a form of AI which operates on owner's behalf without any interference of that ownership entity.

## Genetic Algorithms

Genetic Algorithms carefully consider autonomous agent attributes and combines them with the environmental factors to create a balanced simulation. Attributes explored in this project include mass, force, location, velocity, acceleration, energy, vision, age, and maturity.

## Technology Used

This Project uses following technology:

- HTML
- CSS
- JQuery/Javascript
- Github
- Jekyll
