In the first iteration, we defined agent types and agent attributes. As of result, ground work of the whole project, Organism, was created.

Organism Types were defined according to the organism attributes.

## Organism Attributes

Following are the main attributes of the organisms:

- Generation
- Mass
- Force
- Location
- Velocity
- Acceleration
- Energy
- Vision
- Age
- Mature
- Fertility

We only briefly explored the possible agent types in this iteration where types are defined by few main attributes such as mass, velocity, vision & sense, fertility.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
// Oragnism Identity & Attributes
Function Organism(generation, mass, x, y, visionRange, visionAngle, minSpeed, maxSpeed, fertility){
  this.ID = Organism.uid();
  this.generation = generation;
  this.mass = mass;
  this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
  this.minSpeed = minSpeed;
  this.maxForce = 1 / (this.mass); // amount of force it can exert [2, ]
  this.vision = new Vision(this, vision_range, vision_angle);
  this.vision = new Vision(this, visionRange, visionAngle);
  this.fertility = fertility;
  this.energy = 0.5 * this.mass * this.maxSpeed * this.maxSpeed;
  this.age = 1;
}

// Create a function that takes two arguments and returns the sum of those arguments
var adder = new Function("a", "b", "return a + b");

// Call the function
adder(2, 6);
// > 8
```
